This Python code is an implementation of the N-Queens problem using the backtracking algorithm. The N-Queens problem is a puzzle where you have to place N queens on an NxN chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other.

```python
def is_safe(board, row, col):
    for i in range(row):
        if board[i] == col or abs(board[i] - col) == row - i:
            return False
    return True
```

1. The `is_safe` function checks if it is safe to place a queen at a given position on the board. It takes three parameters: the current board configuration, the row, and the column of the position being checked. It iterates over the rows above the current row and checks if any of the previously placed queens conflict with the current position. If there is a conflict, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

```python
def backtracking(n):
    board = [-1] * n
    row = 0

    board[0] = random.randint(0, n-1)
    
    while row < n:
        col = board[row] + 1

        while col < n:
            if is_safe(board, row, col):
                board[row] = col
                row += 1
                break
            col += 1

        if col == n:
            board[row] = -1
            row -= 1

        elif row == n:
            return board

    return None

```

2. The `backtracking` function takes a single parameter `n` representing the size of the chessboard. It initializes an empty board of size `n` and sets the first queen's position randomly on the first row.

3. It enters a while loop that continues until all queens are placed on the board. Inside the loop, it starts from the current row and tries to find a safe position by incrementing the column value. If a safe position is found, it places the queen at that position and moves to the next row. If no safe position is found in the current row, it goes back to the previous row and tries to find a different position.

4. If it reaches a point where it cannot place any queen on the board, it goes back to the previous row and tries a different position. If all rows have been explored and a valid solution is found, it returns the board configuration. Otherwise, it returns `None` if no solution is possible.

The code employs the backtracking algorithm to explore and backtrack through different configurations until a valid solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.
